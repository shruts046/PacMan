# PacMan
**Part 1: Search in Pacman**
Focuses on implementing various search algorithms to guide the Pacman agent through mazes for efficient food collection and goal-reaching. 
Key Components
search.py: Contains all search algorithms.
searchAgents.py: Contains search-based agents.
pacman.py: Main file to run Pacman games.
game.py: Logic behind Pacman world.
util.py: Useful data structures for search algorithms.
Objectives
Implement search algorithms: Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search.
Apply these algorithms in various Pacman scenarios.
Develop a heuristic for the CornersProblem and FoodSearchProblem.
