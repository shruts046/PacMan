# PacMan
**Part 1: Search in Pacman**
Focuses on implementing various search algorithms to guide the Pacman agent through mazes for efficient food collection and goal-reaching. 
Key Components
search.py: Contains all search algorithms.
searchAgents.py: Contains search-based agents.
pacman.py: Main file to run Pacman games.
game.py: Logic behind Pacman world.
util.py: Useful data structures for search algorithms.
Objectives
Implement search algorithms: Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search.
Apply these algorithms in various Pacman scenarios.
Develop a heuristic for the CornersProblem and FoodSearchProblem.

**Part 2: Multi-Agent Search**
The Pacman series introduces Multi-Agent Search, where we design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. The project involves implementing adversarial search strategies like minimax and expectimax, and crafting evaluation functions for more efficient gameplay.
Key Components
multiAgents.py: Where we will write multi-agent search agents.
Pacman.py: This is the main file for running Pacman games and describing the GameState.
game.py: Contains the logic of the Pacman world.
util.py: Useful data structures for implementing search algorithms.
Objectives
Implement a Reflex Agent that considers both food and ghost locations.
Develop a Minimax agent capable of handling multiple ghosts.
Implement Alpha-Beta Pruning for efficient tree exploration.
Design an Expectimax agent to handle the probabilistic behavior of agents.
Craft a sophisticated evaluation function for game state assessment.
